# React Native Calculator App
### A simple example of a calculator app built with React Native and Redux

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

Run `yarn install` then run `yarn test` to run tests or `yarn start` to run the app in development mode (you can use `npm` alternatively).

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it.
